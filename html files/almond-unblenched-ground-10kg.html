  <p>
    Our organic unblended ground almonds are unprocessed with their skin left intact, perfectly delicious, loaded with nutrition, and significant in size. The skin is perfectly edible and provides the body with additional fiber and antioxidants. The robust flavor of organic almonds makes them a superior snack. They are crunchy, nutty, and have a distinct sweet taste. Almonds are considered to have a higher nutritional density that is they offer the greatest amount of nutrients per calorie. Every organic raw almond provides a hearty dose of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, manganese, calcium, and MUFA good for cholesterol. MUFA in almonds cannot only lower the LDL but it can keep full for a really long time.
