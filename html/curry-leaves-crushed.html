<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Crushed curry leaves are shiny and dark green in color and have a distinct aroma and taste. Curry leaves recipe
    involves the use of fresh curry as well as powdered curry leaves to enhance the flavor of salads, chutneys and
    spices. The health benefits of curry leaves include improved functioning of the small intestine and stomach,
    improved quality of digestive juices during digestion, and increased salivary secretion. The leaves have a strong
    aroma, reminding one of anise and citrus. Curry leaves health benefits also include relief from kidney pain,
    treatment of minor superficial skin injuries, and managing diabetes. Our curry leaves are prepared by drying fresh
    leaves every week and have more subtle flavor than the fresh. Dried curry leaves have an appetizing aroma of roasted

    pale green undersides, firm and fairly stiff leaves. The scent is so refreshing that it instantly tantalizes the
