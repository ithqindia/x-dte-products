<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Cinnamon bark is widely used as a spice. It is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavoring
    material. It is used in the preparation of chocolate, especially in Mexico, which is the main importer of true
    cinnamon. It is also used in many desserts recipes, such as apple pie, donuts, and cinnamon buns as well as spicy
    candies, tea, hot cocoa, and liqueurs. True cinnamon, rather than cassia, is more suitable for use in sweet dishes.
    In the Middle East, it is often used in savory dishes of chicken and lamb. In the United States, cinnamon and sugar
    are often used to flavor cereals, bread-based dishes, and fruits, especially apples; a cinnamon-sugar mixture is
    even sold separately for such purposes. Cinnamon can also be used in pickling. Cinnamon bark is one of the few
    spices that can be consumed directly.
