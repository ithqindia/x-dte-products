    According to the Bible, cumin had such powerful medicinal value that it could be used as an antiseptic but has been
    more recently recognized as an excellent digestive and stomach disorder settler. A very important spice, both
    nationally as well as for Morarka. It has been very difficult to convert the cultivation of this spice to organic.
    In Rajasthan, south west districts have been very famous for the good quality of cumin produced there and generally
    harvested in April -May. Cumin has long been known for its digestive properties. It relieves flatulence, bloating
    gas and other related stomach ailments. Cumin seeds have long been considered stimulant carminative, stomachic,
    astringent, diuretic. Paste made from cumin seeds and peppermint oil helps to relieve abdominal pain and liver
    disorder. Cumin is very good source of iron. Morarka has also been supported by many Government programs to become
    the single largest producer of organic cumin in the country. Cumin quality in the trade circle is evaluated on the
    basis of uniformly bold size of the grain, color, aroma & taste. Our variety of organic Cumin whole is of premium
