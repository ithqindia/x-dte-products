<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In the Bible, coriander is compared with Manna. The Chinese associated it with immortality, valued it for its
    medicinal and reputed aphrodisiacal quality as well as due to its distinct flavor it has been used in Chinese
    cooking for hundreds of years. Coriander has been used as folk medicine for the relief of anxiety and insomnia.
    Coriander is used in traditional medicine as diuretic by boiling equal amount of coriander seed and cumin seed. This
    is a major spice, both produced and consumed in very large quantities. It is used as carminative and as digestive
    aid. The aromatic odor and taste of coriander seed is due to an essential oil. Coriander seeds are chewed to correct
    foul breaths. An infusion of the seeds in combination with cardamom and caraway seeds is useful in flatulence,
    indigestion, vomiting and intestinal disorders.In Rajasthan, south east districts are traditionally known for this
    spice and are harvested in March- April. Coriander quality is evaluated for its color, size, aroma, number of broken
    seeds, and after taste. Mostly it is yellow green in color but in some regions brown coriander is also cultivated.
