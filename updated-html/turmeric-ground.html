<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  Turmeric an ancient spice which is an antioxidant due to the phenolic
  character of curcumin. It is stomachic, carminative tonic, blood purifier,
  vermicide and antiseptic. It imparts yellow color to curries and is an
  important ingredient both for its color as well as for its medicinal
  properties. Boiled with warm milk and taken or used as an inhalation from
  boiling water or as smoke through pipe, it relieves sore throat and common
  cold. It is considered one of the best as it is rich in coloring matter
  (curcumin). Institutional clients prefer turmeric with high curcumine content
  i.e. above 3.0 percent responsible for imparting yellow color, while for
  domestic consumption turmeric with 2.0-3.0 value is preferred. Morarka has
  originally developed organic turmeric cultivation in Maharashtra project
  areas, and has now expanded it to Northeast region as well. Mostly turmeric is
  sold as powder, and very small quantities are also sold as whole in
  international markets. The fresh range of turmeric powder offered by us is
  widely demanded in the National and International market for its high aroma,
  taste and purity. Our range of turmeric powder is natural bright yellow in
  color and adds a spicy flavor in various cuisines. Turmeric powder is
  extremely pungent and actually gets stronger when cooked. Although a pinch of
  turmeric may be used as a substitute for saffron to achieve that golden yellow
  color.
