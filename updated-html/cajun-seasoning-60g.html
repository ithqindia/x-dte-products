    Regular Cajun Seasoning has a nice level of heat, enough to add some zip to your food but mild enough for those who don’t want too much. It has a versatile flavor that many people use in place of a seasoned salt, as well is in Cajun classics like blackened fish.

        Cajun Seasoning is a great blend for Cajun cooks and non-Cajun cooks alike. These seasonings create the flavor you get when biting into a blackened dish. The actual blackening is done by a very hot fire, either a gas grill or in a professional kitchen – know that if you try to blacken at home you may set off your fire alarm. We love this seasoning even without being blackened as it’s simply a really tasty seasoning great for many purposes. To add a little zest to your food, use 1 teaspoon per pound for catfish, steak, grilled chicken wings, ribs, chops, and red snapper. It’s also lovely sprinkled on eggs or vegetables, and makes amazing Cajun fries. Hand mixed from:half-sharp Hungarian paprika, salt, ground celery seed, garlic powder, Italian herbs, onion, cumin, Tellicherry black pepper, sugar, hot pepper, curry powder, turmeric, dill, mace and cardamom. Sodium content: 398.96 mg per teaspoon; 12.59% sodium.
