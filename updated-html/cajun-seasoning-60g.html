<p> Cajun Seasoning Organic 60g $6.99 Regular Cajun Seasoning has a nice level of heat, enough to add some zip to your
  food but mild enough for those who don't want too much. It has a versatile flavor that many people use in place of a
  seasoned salt, as well is in Cajun classics like blackened fish. </p>
