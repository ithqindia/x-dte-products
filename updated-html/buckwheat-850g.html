The nutrients in buckwheat may contribute to blood sugar control. Buckwheat lipid lowering activity is largely due to flavonoid compounds. These compounds help in maintaining blood flow, keep platelets from clotting excessively. Buckwheat contains no gluten and can subsequently be eaten by people with celiac disease and gluten allergy.
