<h4 class="h4-class">Description</h4>
<p>

    A very important spice crop demanded as whole, flakes and powder, and is regularly consumed in very large
    quantities. It imparts color and pungency, both of which play a key role in the repertoire of food preparation and
    presentation. Pungency is the most sought after quality parameter of the chili. These seeds are responsible for the
    burning sensation in the stomach. All Down to Earth chilies are sun dried. The stem and seeds are removed and the
    chili is then grounded. This keeps the aroma and the taste intact while imparting your curries with the right amount
    of pungency. Our most popular range of chili has a heat value of 15000-40000, which is considered ideal as it lends
    food its color and aroma, and not just heat and pungency.
