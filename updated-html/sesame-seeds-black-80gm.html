  drank wine made from sesame seeds. In Orissa, Raashi ladu (sweet made of
  Sesame) is a must as an offering to Lord Ganesha. White sesame seeds mixed
  with rice are offered to the gods and seers of the Veda. Both of these
  offerings are called tarpanam. Sesame oil is used to pacify the malefic effect
  of Lord Shani (Saturn). Sesame is grown primarily for its oil-rich seeds,
  which come in a variety of colors, from cream-white to charcoal-black. The
