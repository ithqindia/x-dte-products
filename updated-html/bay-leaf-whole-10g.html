<p> Bay Leaf Whole Organic 10g $3.49 Bay leaf is the aromatic leaf used in many cuisines. Morarka organics' Fresh or dried bay leaves can be used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance. If eaten whole, they have a pungent, sharp and bitter taste. The fragrance of the bay leaf is more noticeable than its taste. When dried, the fragrance is herbal, slightly floral, and somewhat similar to oregano and thyme. The leaves are most often used whole and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more of their desired fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bagor tea infuse. </p>
