<p> Oregano Organic 35g $3.49 The herb oregano is a native of the Mediterranean region where it grows abundantly. Its Latin name, Origanum vulgare, means “joy of the mountains” (where it is often found growing). Oregano is closely related to marjoram; in fact oregano is wild marjoram and is stronger in flavor than marjoram. The oregano plant bears tiny leaves, which have a pungent scent and strong flavor. Its edible flowers are pink or purple and may be eaten in salads or used as a garnish. Oregano leaves may be used fresh or dried (the flavor is more pungent when the leaves are dried). It is the ultimate herb to use in tomato bases in pizzas. Oregano is a helpful herb for relieving digestive discomfort and coughs. It is high in antioxidant activity due to high content of phenolic acid and flavonoids. Oregano works well with tomato dishes, including pizza, spaghetti, chili and a variety of Italian dishes. It works well with other herbs and flavoring, for example garlic, onion, thyme, basil, parsley and olive oil. Add oregano in the end of the cooking process to maximize its flavor. </p>
