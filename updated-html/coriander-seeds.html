  immortality, valued it for its medicinal and reputed aphrodisiacal quality as
  well as due to its distinct flavor it has been used in Chinese cooking for
  hundreds of years. Coriander has been used as folk medicine for the relief of
  anxiety and insomnia. Coriander is used in traditional medicine as diuretic by
  boiling equal amount of coriander seed and cumin seed. This is a major spice,
  both produced and consumed in very large quantities. It is used as carminative
  and as digestive aid. The aromatic odor and taste of coriander seed is due to
  an essential oil. Coriander seeds are chewed to correct foul breaths. An
  infusion of the seeds in combination with cardamom and caraway seeds is useful
  in flatulence, indigestion, vomiting and intestinal disorders.In Rajasthan,
  south east districts are traditionally known for this spice and are harvested
  in March- April. Coriander quality is evaluated for its color, size, aroma,
