<h4 class="h4-class">Description</h4>
<p>
    Five spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck,
    pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods.Five spice is used in recipes for
    Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The
    five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines
    throughout Asia. Although this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, few Chinese households use it in day-to-day
    cooking. In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron’s table. A seasoned salt can be
    easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt
    are well mixed.
