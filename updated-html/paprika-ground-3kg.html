  Paprika Ground Organic 3kg $60.30 This organic paprika has a darker color than
  most sweet paprikas, with an earthy, raisiny flavor reminiscent of ground
  ancho pepper. The deep flavor is a wonderful choice for Middle Eastern and
  North African cooking, or in any recipe with strong flavors.

<h4 class="h4-class">Description</h4>
<p>
  Paprika is far more than a dusting of color on top of potato salads and
  deviled eggs. Fresh paprika has the full flavor of the peppers it was ground
  from. Originating, like all chili peppers, in the Americas, paprika peppers
  are now strongly associated with Hungarian cuisine. Paprika can range in
  flavor from mild and sweet to fiery hot, and is used heavily in Eastern
  European cooking. The Spice House offers five varieties of paprika. Classic
  Hungarian sweet paprika remains our top seller, and was voted best in the
  country by Cooks Illustrated. Half-sharp Hungarian has all the rich flavor of
  the Sweet, with a sharp heat. The beautiful, deep red color of the California
  paprika makes it aesthetically pleasing. Recently, Spanish smoked paprikas
  have come into vogue. Their smokey flavor comes from a slow drying process
  over oak-burning fires. Try any of our freshly ground paprikas and discover
  that paprika flavor can be as interesting and important as its magnificent
  color.
