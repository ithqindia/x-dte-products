<p>
  The ancient Aryans considered it as a powerful remedy for various disorders of
  the anatomical system and prescribed it as an effective cure for dyspepsia
  malaria, delirium. The Egyptian used it for embalming. The Asians are said to
  have it as an aphrodisiac. Pepperine is considered to be the major constituent
  responsible for the bitter taste of black pepper and has been used to impart
  pungency to dishes.The high value and very high cost of cultivation has
  increased the risk, and thus commercial growers take extra ordinary
  precautions in the cultivation of Black Pepper. With the result under
  conventional farming there is a very heavy use of Chemical Pesticides in
  commercial cultivation. At Morarka it is sourced from certified organic farms
  Karnataka, Kerala & Tamilnadu.One of the principle values of pepper is its
  ability to correct the seasonings of dishes. Just before the end of cooking,
  final dash of pepper can be used effectively to adjust the flavor. Due to
  strong aromatic property, it constitutes an important component of culinary
  seasonings of universal use and an essential ingredient of numerous commercial
  food stuffs.
