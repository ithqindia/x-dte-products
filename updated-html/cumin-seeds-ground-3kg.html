<p>
    Cumin powder is an aromatic spice with a distinctive bitter flavor and strong, warm aroma due to its abundant oil
    content. Cumin “seeds” are actually the small dried fruit of an annual plant in the parsley family. Native to the
    Mediterranean, cumin is hotter to the taste, lighter in color, and larger than caraway, another spice it’s sometimes
    confused with. Cumin powder is a popular ingredient in Middle Eastern, Asian, Mediterranean and Mexican cuisines,
    and is one of the main ingredients in curry powder. Cumin powder is beige in color, warm, nutty aroma and a taste
    that is bitter, but not hot. Cumin powder is usually used to flavor rice, stuffed vegetables, many savory dishes and
    curries. It combines well with cilantro.
