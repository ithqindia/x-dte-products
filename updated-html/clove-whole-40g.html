<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Clove is one of the most ancient and valuable spices of the orient. This spice is later known to Chinese in 266 B.C.
    In India clove was introduced in 1800A.D. by the East-India company. The term clove is derived from the French word
    clove and English word clout both meaning nail-from the likeness of the flower bud of the clove tree to a broad-head
    nail. Our organic Clove is very aromatic, has a fine flavor and imparts warming qualities. It is used as a culinary
    spice as the flavor blends well with both sweet and savory dishes. It is highly valued as carminative, aromatic and
    stimulant. This good quality clove has stimulating properties due to the reason that it is also used in flatulence
    and dyspepsia. Because of pungent and spicy taste, it is used for flavoring curries, Jellies, pickles, ketchup,
    sauces, spice mixtures and pickling spice. This product is untouched by chemicals, fertilizers, toxic pesticides, or
