<p> Buckwheat Dehulled Organic 25kg $139.99 Buckwheat is an unusually fast-growing crop with a variety of uses. It is not a true cereal and so it is known as Pseudocereal. Buckwheat seeds are dehulled and the remaining seed material is ground into flour. We provide the best quality of organic Buckwheat which is high in lysine; protein content is about 12% with only 2% fat. The nutrients in buckwheat may contribute to blood sugar control. Buckwheat lipid-lowering activity is largely due to flavonoid compounds. These compounds help in maintaining blood flow, keep platelets from clotting excessively. Buckwheat contains no gluten and can subsequently be eaten by people with celiac disease and gluten allergy. Buckwheat flour is generally dark-colored due to the presence of hull fragments not being removed during the milling process. </p>
